The paper investigates which specific soft and technological skills are most important for HR managers when adopting AI-based HR technologies. A Rapid Evidence Assessment (REA) of recent HRM and AI literature shows that AI is transforming HR from an administrative function toward strategic, analytics-enabled roles, increasing demand for both digital competencies (e.g., data literacy, HR analytics, digital safety, and communication) and human-centric capabilities such as critical thinking, leadership, and emotional–social intelligence. To complement the literature, the study combines O*NET occupational skill data with the AI Labor Index, aggregating soft and technological skill scores and AI exposure measures (task complexity, LLM and software automation) for 894 occupations, including key HR manager roles.

Using MANOVA and regression models, the quantitative analysis finds that AI-related variables jointly and significantly shape skill requirements, with task complexity emerging as the strongest predictor of both soft and technological skill demand, and LLM exposure positively associated with soft skills but negatively with technological skills. K-means clustering further shows that HR managers are located in a high-complexity, skill-intensive cluster, characterised by strong soft skill demands and moderate, complementary technological requirements. Synthesising the evidence, the paper concludes that effective AI adoption in HR hinges on a dual capability profile: robust technological skills in data and digital tools, coupled with advanced soft skills in critical thinking, leadership, communication, and emotional intelligence, and highlights persistent gaps in analytics, ethical AI use, and human-centred competencies that organisations must address through targeted upskilling.
